# arp-spoofer
This is a arp spoofer python script for linux  

In brief, it is a method of gaining a man-in-the-middle situation. Technically speaking, it is a technique by which an attacker sends spoofed ARP packets (false packets) onto the network (or specific hosts), enabling the attacker to intercept, change or modify network traffic on the fly. ARP spoofing is a malicious attack in which the hacker sends falsified ARP in a network. Every node in a connected network has an ARP table through which we identify the IP address and the MAC address of the connected devices. Once you (as an attacker) are a man in the middle, you can literally intercept or change everything that passes in or out of the victim's device.
